                Sentiments, or beliefs about aggregate demand, can be self-fulfilling in models departing slightly from the complete information benchmark in the New Keynesian framework. Through its effect on aggregate variables, the policy stance determines the degree of complementarity in firms’ production (pricing) decisions and consequently, the precision of endogenous signals that firms receive. As a result, aggregate fluctuations can be driven by both fundamental and non-fundamental shocks. The distribution of non-fundamental shocks is endogenous to policy, introducing a novel trade-off between sta- bilizing output and inflation. Both strong inflation targeting and nominal flexibilities increase the variance of non-fundamental shocks, which are shown to be suboptimal. Moreover, the Taylor principle is no longer sufficient to rule out indeterminacy. Instead, an interest rate rule that places sufficiently low weight on inflation eliminates non-fundamental volatility and thereby the output-inflation trade-off.

		How does household heterogeneity affect the transmission of an energy price shock? What
are the implications for monetary policy? We develop a small open economy TANK model
that features labor and an energy import good as production inputs (Gas-TANK). Given complementarities
in production inputs, higher energy prices reduce the labor share of total income.
Due to borrowing constraints, this translates into a drop in aggregate demand. Higher
price flexibility insures firm profits from adverse energy price shocks, further depressing labor
income and demand. We illustrate how the transmission of shocks in a RANK versus a
TANK depends on the degree of complementarity between energy and labor in production
and the degree of price rigidities. Optimal monetary policy is less contractionary in a TANK
and can even be expansionary when credit constraints are severe. Finally, the contractionary
effect of an energy price shock on demand cannot be generalized to alternate supply shocks,
as the specific nature of the supply shock affects how resources are redistributed in the economy.
