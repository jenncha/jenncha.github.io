                How does household heterogeneity affect the transmission of an energy price shock? What 
		are the implications for monetary policy? We develop a small open economy TANK model
		that features labor and an energy import good as production inputs (Gas-TANK). Given complementarities
		in production inputs, higher energy prices reduce the labor share of total income.
		Due to borrowing constraints, this translates into a drop in aggregate demand. Higher
		price flexibility insures firm profits from adverse energy price shocks, further depressing labor
		income and demand. We illustrate how the transmission of shocks in a RANK versus a
		TANK depends on the degree of complementarity between energy and labor in production
		and the degree of price rigidities. Optimal monetary policy is less contractionary in a TANK
		and can even be expansionary when credit constraints are severe. Finally, the contractionary
		effect of an energy price shock on demand cannot be generalized to alternate supply shocks,
		as the specific nature of the supply shock affects how resources are redistributed in the economy.

                Sentiments, or beliefs about aggregate demand, can be self-fulfilling in models departing slightly from the 
		complete information benchmark in the New Keynesian framework. Through its effect on aggregate variables, 
		the policy stance determines the degree of complementarity in firms’ production (pricing) decisions and consequently, 
		the precision of endogenous signals that firms receive. As a result, aggregate fluctuations can be driven by both 
		fundamental and non-fundamental shocks. The distribution of non-fundamental shocks is endogenous to policy, 
		introducing a novel trade-off between stabilizing output and inflation. Both strong inflation targeting 
		and nominal flexibilities increase the variance of non-fundamental shocks, which are shown to be suboptimal. 
		Moreover, the Taylor principle is no longer sufficient to rule out indeterminacy. Instead, an interest rate 
		rule that places sufficiently low weight on inflation eliminates non-fundamental volatility and thereby the output-inflation trade-off.

		This chapter explores the patterns of spatial disparities within countries 
		throughout the 20th Century. While the post-World War II period
		witnessed a narrowing of regional income gaps, the subsequent decades
		have experienced a deceleration in convergence rates, with some countries
		even exhibiting divergence. Despite narrowing income gaps, the incomplete
		nature of regional income convergence has led to persistent relative income
		disparities over the 20th century. We synthesize recent contributions seeking
		to explain these patterns, with an emphasis on insights from quantitative
		economic geography and macroeconomics. Recent contributions in these
		fields shed light on important forces of regional convergence, divergence, and
		persistence. Finally, we examine the evidence on the impact of “place-based
		policies”, focusing on large-scale programs designed to promote regional convergence.

                How does trade fragmentation affect inflationary pressures? What is the response of monetary policy needed to sustain 
		inflation at target? To answer these questions, we develop a heterogeneous agent, open-economy model featuring imperfect 
		international risk-sharing. The model captures both the demand and supply side effects of fragmentation. 
		It illustrates how the impact of fragmentation on inflationary pressures and the appropriate policy response depend 
		not only on the direct effect of higher import prices on supply but, crucially, on how aggregate demand adjusts in 
		response to lower real incomes and productivity stemming from fragmentation.

    		(draft available upon request)
		<br><button class="accordion"></button> <div class="panel" id="section01">
                Since 1900, rural regions in Europe experienced more rapid income growth and
		rapid industrialization than urban regions. Did lower transportation costs enable
		this rural catchup? We explore this question using historical data from Norway and
		European regions since 1900. In both cases, we find that improvements in market
		access accelerated structural transformation out of agriculture in regions that were
		initially specialized in agriculture. To interpret this pattern, we build a multi-sector
		dynamic spatial model equilibrium of structural transformation that we take to
		the data. Through counterfactuals exercises, we find that lower transportation
		costs accelerated structural transformation in rural locations, but are insufficient to
		account for the full catchup observed in the data. Our findings suggest alternative
		mechanisms are important in accounting for rural catchup across European regions.

                We study a New Keynesian model where production inputs and pricing decisions are made under
		information frictions. Firm production is constrained by inputs chosen before shocks are known,
		i.e., based on expectations of demand. We show that the assumption of real rigidities versus nominal
		rigidities is not innocuous, as assuming the presence of either or both affects the pass-through of demand
		shocks to aggregate output and inflation. When production inputs are made under imperfect
		information about demand shocks, the impact on aggregate demand is dampened. When both production
		inputs and pricing decisions are made under imperfect information about demand shocks, the
		pass-through to aggregate demand is complete.
