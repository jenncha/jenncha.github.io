                I study optimal monetary policy in the presence of non-fundamental sources of fluctuations. Beliefs about aggregate demand can be self-fulfilling in models departing slightly from the complete information benchmark in the New Keynesian framework. Through its effect on aggregate variables, the stance of policy determines the precision of endogenous signals that firms receive, and consequently, the degree of coordination in firms’ production (pricing) decision. As a result, the distribution of non-fundamental shocks is no longer independent of policy, introducing a novel trade-off between stabilizing output and inflation. Both strong inflation targeting and nominal flexibilities increase the variance of non-fundamental shocks, which are shown to be suboptimal. The Taylor rule is no longer sufficient to rule out indeterminacy. Instead, an interest rate rule that places sufficiently low weight on inflation eliminates non-fundamental volatility and hence the output-inflation trade-off. While these results extend to the case where fluctuations are driven by both fundamental and non-fundamental shocks, a policymaker unable to distinguish between the two sources cannot eliminate non-fundamental volatility.

		How does household heterogeneity affect the transmission of an energy price shock? What are the implications for monetary policy? We develop a small open economy TANK model that features labor and an energy import good as production inputs. Given complementar- ities in production inputs, higher energy prices reduce the labor share of total income. Due to borrowing constraints, this translates into a drop in aggregate demand. Higher price flex- ibility relative to wage flexibility insures firm profits from adverse energy price shocks. We illustrate how the transmission of shocks in RANK versus TANK depends on the degree of complementarity between energy and labor in production and the degree of relative wage and price stickiness.
